Every source code file submitted must include authorship documentation. The documentation
of your program must include an authorship and program introduction section before any code.

This initial section must provide the following information:
    Class name i.e. Program written for CS II
    Assignment number i.e. Assign 2
    Program author(s) i.e. Program written by Dr. Rouse
    Date of last modification i.e. Last Modified on 1/10/2018
    OS used i.e. Windows 10
    IDE used i.e. Notepad++ and command line
    Brief description of the program, its expected inputs, outputs, and process.

Program comments must appear on the lines immediately above the section of code they are
describing and should be aligned with the current level of indentation.

Comments should be preceded by a blank line unless the preceding line contains a single block
delimiter. Comment lines should not be followed by blank lines.

A brief description of functionality must appear immediately before any method heading.

There must be a space between math operators and assignment symbol i.e.
num = 3 + 5;
 not
num=3+5;

All curly braces will open at end of line it is blocking for and close on separate line (see example
below)

Limit any line in your program to 90 or less characters. i.e. don’t let it go off screen

All levels of indention will consist of 3 spaces (see example below)

// This program prints Welcome to Java!
public class Welcome {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      //This is the welcoming statement
      System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
   }
}
